          Countries – matched boundary lines and polygons with names attributes for countries and sovereign states.
          Includes dependencies (French Polynesia), map units (U.S. Pacific Island Territories) and sub-national
          map subunits (Corsica versus mainland Metropolitan France).
          
          Countries distinguish between metropolitan (homeland) and independent and semi-independent portions
          of sovereign states. To see the dependent overseas regions broken out (like in ISO codes, see France for example),
          use map units instead.

        description: |
          [LandScan](http://www.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/) derived population estimates are provided for 90% of our cities.
          Those lacking population estimates are often in sparsely inhabited areas. We provide a range of population values
          that account for the total “metropolitan” population rather than it’s administrative boundary population.
          Use the PopMax column to size your town labels.
          Starting in version 1.1, popMax has been throttled down to the UN estimated metro population
          for the ~500 largest urban areas in the world.
          This affects towns in China, India, and parts of Africa where our Landscan counting method usually over estimated.

          Population estimates were derived from the LANDSCAN dataset maintained and distributed by the Oak Ridge National
          Laboratory. These data were converted from raster to vector and pixels with fewer than 200 persons per square
          kilometer were removed from the dataset as they were classified as rural.
          Once urban pixels were selected, these pixels were aggregated into contiguous units.
          Concurrently Thiessen polygons were created based on the selected city points.
          The Thiessen polygons were used to intersect the contiguous city boundaries to produce bounded areas for the cities.
          As a result, our estimates capture a metropolitan and micropolitan populations per city regardless of
          administrative units.

          Once intersected, the contiguous polygons were recalculated, using aerial interpolation assuming uniform
          population distribution within each pixel, to determine the population total.
          This process was conducted multiple times, for each scale level, to produce population estimates for each city
          at nested scales of 1:300 million, 1:110 million, 1:50 million, 1:20 million, and 1:10 million.
          
          Population ranks

          Are calculated as rank_max and rank_min using this general VB formula that can be pasted into ArcMap
          Field Calculator advanced area (set your output to x):

              a = [pop_max]

              if( a > 10000000 ) then
              x = 14
              elseif( a > 5000000 ) then
              x = 13
              elseif( a > 1000000 ) then

          Issues:

          New version of the MODIS-derived urban area grid is now available (announcement, data download) at 0.5 km
          and uses an improved algorithm for better accuracy:

          No scale ranks. Missing just a couple polygons for points included in populated places.

          Could be split apart (intersected with thiessen polygons derived from populated places points) and joined with
          populated places points to derive names and population values (and density).

        description: |
          Ocean coastline, including major islands. Coastline is matched to land and water polygons.
          The Caspian Sea, which is technically a lake, is included. The ocean coastline, the foundation for building all
          of NEV, primarily derives from World Data Bank 2 with modest generalization applied via line simplification
          in Adobe Illustrator. The Antarctica coast derives from NASA Mosaic of Antarctica.
